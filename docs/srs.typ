= personal dashboard software requirement specification 

Personal dashboard to keep up with personal work & todos ( tracking time, overview of task deadlines, eisenhower method, brag document ), social connections & events ( friend database, reconnection reminders ), health & fitness ( habits such as taking multivitamins & working out ), daily journaling, maybe even study related stuff


== work & todos

- add work category / job
- list work categories / jobs


=== todo management / planning

- add todo ( name, description, deadline / priority )
- list todos
- start tracking time for job
- stop tracking time for job
- list time spent on a job in the last week


brag documents

right now the todos can be displayed in a table
( work, todo name, deadline if any , priority, description ),

in the future we could draw a dependency diagram

priority could be a number 1 through 3.
- 1 is the lowest priority ("nice to have")
- 2 is the medium priority ("should have")
- 3 is the highest priority ("as soon as possible")

UI should come first
